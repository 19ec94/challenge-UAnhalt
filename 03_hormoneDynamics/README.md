The directory `03_hormoneDynamics` contains code to compute simulation results 
from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1137/120904238).

## InterfaceType::FluxContinuity

To run a file named `1d_fluxContinuity_noSource.cpp` , execute the following (for example in linux)

```bash
g++ --std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Warray-bounds 1d_fluxContinuity_noSource.cpp
```

to compile and then run  

```bash
./a.out
```

to execute.

Note: This work is under progress. More details will follow soon.
