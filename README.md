This repository contains solutions to three computational problems.

## 01_combinatorics

**Problem statement**

How many ways can you color the facets of a cube if there are **c = 5 colors** available and each color can only be used on **m = 2 facets or less**? Note that rotated cubes represent the same coloring and only count once. Please write code that enumerates the relevant color combinations and, if possible, make the code variable with respect to the two parameters, **c** and **m**.

**Solution**

See [01_combinatorics/README.md](./01_combinatorics/README.md).

## 02_statistics

**Problem statement**

Choose **n random points** in two dimensions. Calculate **Pearson's correlation coefficient**. Repeat this procedure **r times**. What is the mathematical distribution of these correlation coefficients as **r → ∞**? Please write code, review the results for a few small values of n (e.g. **n = 4, 5, 6**), and then make a prediction for arbitrary n.

**Solution**

See [02_statistics/README.md](./02_statistics/README.md).

## 03_hormone_dynamics

**Research statement**

Given a distribution function \(\phi(x, y, u(t))\) (which describes cell density), write a program to study the evolution of this distribution function over space and time as described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1137/120904238).

**Solution**

See [03_hormoneDynamics/README.md](./03_hormoneDynamics/README.md).
